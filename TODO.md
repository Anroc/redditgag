## For the near future

- [ ] add an original-link button that contains the original url
- [x] just generally more info from the post like name of OP and subreddit
- [ ] finish imgur and gfycat providers
  - [x] since imgur and gfycat both require api's to get all the information, I
    first have to implement some kind of caching system

## For the not quite so near future

- [x] ~~find a markdown renderer and add support for self posts~~
  - This was unneccessary because the reddit api already provides rendered html
- [ ] propper parameter support for youtube (timestamps, playlists)
- [ ] add a javascript guided tour of the site
- [ ] pagination (currently we can only display the top 25 results)
- [ ] lazy loading (loading embeddables only when the user scrolls to them)

## For the really not anywhere near near future

- [ ] reddit login to up and downvote and have personalized frontpage
- [ ] support other sorting methods beside best (e.g. new, top)
