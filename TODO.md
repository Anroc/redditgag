## For the near future

* add an original-link button that contains the original url
* just generally more info from the post like name of OP and subreddit
* finish imgur and gfycat providers

## For the not quite so near future

* find a markdown renderer and add support for self posts
* propper parameter support for youtube (timestamps, playlists)
* add a javascript guided tour of the site

## For the really not anywhere near near future

* reddit login to up and downvote and have personalized frontpage
